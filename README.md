# Gaia WebApp - Zoo Hackathon 2020 Brasil
This project was developed as a submission for the Zoo Hackathon 2020 Brasil.

Gaia is a database platform that organizes and storages data about trafficked flora and fauna registered by the organization or person responsible (Federal and Environmental Police, NGOs, scientific staff, etc) for each specific information - i.e. a police officer is responsible for registering an information about the charge, who was fined and how many animals were apprehended; 
CETAS (Wildlife Reception and Rehabilitation Centers) is responsible to feed the database with information about the animal health and prognosis.

It is meant to be used with an unified and well kept database, made to bring together useful and downright essential information to the user.

We aimed to make very straightforward and precise forms. Better forms means better and faster data collection.

Using Capacitor we are able to run it as a mobile app, as well as a web app. Bringing together many devices for convenience and usability.
